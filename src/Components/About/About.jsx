            <h1>Hi, I'm Chingiz. Nice to meet you.</h1>
            <p>I like front-end development. For many years I have been learning different web technologies and practicing them by creating different templates and tasks for myself. I always try to create different and attractive design templates and also coding their contents. I really like coding, designing web templates and trying great web pages, animations, effects and others like that.</p>
